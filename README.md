<br>
ðŸ“Œ Overview <br>
With the rise of misinformation, detecting fake news is crucial. This project uses machine learning to classify news articles as real or fake based on their textual content. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning, we aim to build a robust classification model.
<br>
<br>
Features:<br>
- Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer).
- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and NaÃ¯ve Bayes.
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
<br>
Tech Stack:<br>
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries & Tools: scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn
<br>
Workflow: <br>
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for training.
- Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical representations.
- Model Training & Evaluation: Train multiple ML models and compare performance.
- Prediction: Classify new articles as real or fake.
<br>
Results:<br>
- The models achieve high accuracy, with Decision tree and SVM performing the best.
- Performance may vary depending on dataset quality and feature engineering techniques.
